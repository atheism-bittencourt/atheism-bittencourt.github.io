			Fight Against Discrimination
		</h3>
		<p style="margin-top: 6px">
			In 2015, after having lived for 25 years in Austria, Paulo Bittencourt decided to be naturalized Austrian and discovered that permanent residence and perfect mastery of German were no longer enough. Some years before, the law had been hardened to require foreigners to have a high income. Under the new law, 70% of Austrians themselves wouldn’t have the means to become naturalized. In view of this obvious incoherence, which, on top of that, is discriminatory, since it prevents legalized and integrated immigrants from voting, he was the subject of several TV, radio, newspaper and magazine reports. A speech about his case was delivered in the Austrian Parliament. SOS Mitmensch, an Austrian human rights organization, put up posters with his picture all over Vienna. Not long afterward, he became a citizen of Austria.

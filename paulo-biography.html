			As a boy, Paulo Bittencourt dreamed of becoming a comic book and animation artist. At the age of thirteen, he worked afternoons as an illustrator at a newspaper and a graphic arts company in his hometown, Castro, in Brazil.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1989, after five semesters at a Faculty of Theology in São Paulo, he had doubts about becoming a pastor, abandoned his studies and moved to Europe, living temporarily in Portugal, France, England and Germany until, the following year, going to study German in Austria, where he settled.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1992, without any musical training, he passed the entrance test for the Faculties of Solo Singing and Opera of the Conservatory of the City of Vienna. In his final examination, he performed Count Almaviva, in the opera <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
		</p>
		<h5>
			Professional Activity

		<p class="below-h5">
			During his studies, Paulo Bittencourt sang in professional choirs, with performances in Austria, Israel, Italy, Japan and the United States, such as the Concentus Vocalis Choir and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, under the baton of Theodor Guschlbauer, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, the Arnold Schoenberg Choir and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, under the baton of Seiji Ozawa, at the Vienna Konzerthaus and at the Carnegie Hall, in New York, and an independent production of Jacques Offenbach’s <i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i>, with a month-long tour of Japan.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a soloist, he gave recitals in the Schubert Hall of the Vienna Konzerthaus, with works by Heitor Villa-Lobos, and in the Bösendorfer Hall, in Vienna, with works by Villa-Lobos and Oscar Lorenzo Fernández.

		<h5>
			Fight Against Discrimination
		</h5>
		<p class="below-h5">
			In 2015, after having lived for 25 years in Austria, Paulo Bittencourt decided to be naturalized Austrian and discovered that permanent residence and perfect mastery of German were no longer enough. Some years before, the law had been hardened to require foreigners to have a high income. Under the new law, 70% of Austrians themselves wouldn’t have the means to become naturalized. In view of this obvious incoherence, which, on top of that, is discriminatory, since it prevents legalized and integrated immigrants from participating in the democratic process (voting), he was the subject of several TV, radio, newspaper and magazine reports. A speech about his case was delivered in the Austrian Parliament. SOS Mitmensch, an Austrian human rights organization, put up posters with his picture all over Vienna. Not long afterward, he became a citizen of Austria.

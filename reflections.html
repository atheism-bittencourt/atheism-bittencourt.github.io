			If you question followers of the Bible about the savageries their god committed, such as killing the children of Egypt, and the savageries their god ordered to be committed, such as killing the children of neighboring peoples, they will respond: “God is love, but he is also justice!”, a phrase that (besides not justifying the savageries its god committed and ordered to be committed) is not even in the Bible.

			Em seu programa de TV do canal Novo Tempo, o pastor adventista Leandro Quadros responde à pergunta: “Se existe só um criador, foi Deus quem fez o mal?”. Leandro diz que não, pois o mal não seria mais que a mera “ausência do bem”.
		</p>
		<p>
			Para começo de conversa, Isaías 45:7 diz: “Eu formo a luz, e crio as trevas; eu faço a paz, e <em>crio o mal</em>; eu, o Senhor, faço todas estas coisas”. Essa é uma daquelas passagens bíblicas que causam embaraço aos cristãos, razão por que a ignoram. Quando com ela confrontados, dizem: “Está fora de contexto”. De qualquer modo, cristãos afirmam ser monoteístas: para eles, existe só um deus. Assim sendo, tudo tem de ter origem nesse deus, inclusive a “ausência do bem”, isto é, o mal, que não tem como ter outra origem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quando a coisa aperta, cristãos adoram apelar para o tal livre-arbítrio. Contudo, o livre-arbítrio não isenta Deus de ser o criador do mal, pois se criou um universo com a possibilidade da ausência do bem, a possibilidade da ausência do bem também é criação sua.
		</p>
		<p>
			Em outro episódio, questionado sobre o porquê de Deus permitir que crianças sejam estupradas, Leandro Quadros diz que a culpa é dos direitos humanos, que “protegem bandidos”. Alguém precisa urgentemente galardoar esse pastor com o prêmio Desonestidade Intelectual do Ano, pois é funcionário duma igreja que representa um deus que presenteia estupradores com mansões de ouro, se pedirem perdão. Segundo a crença de Leandro, no Céu estupradores perdoados conviverão em perfeita harmonia com suas vítimas — se elas não tiverem tido o azar de ir para o Inferno.

			To believe in God is unnatural. To follow a religion, even more so. You disagree? Then, do this experiment: If you are a Christian or a Muslim, stop going to church or mosque and reading the Bible or the Koran. What do you think will happen? That’s right: your faith will naturally wither. Even if you don’t become an atheist, God will no longer be part of your daily life. At most, you’ll believe in a “creating energy”, nothing like the god of these books, whose supernatural tales will sound to you like bedtime stories.
		</p>
		<p>
			That children believe in fairies and elves is natural. Yet, how could it be natural for adults to believe in, for example, talking snake, invisible beings with wings on their backs and lake of fire and brimstone? It’s, therefore, evident that adults are only able to believe the infantilities of books such as the Bible and the Koran if subjected to relentless indoctrination accompanied by autosuggestion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unintentionally, one of the most influential pastors in Brazil revealed the technique to induce people to believe and prevent them from stopping believing. In a video in which he criticizes the press, Silas Malafaia says: “Our mind decides to believe what it is repeatedly told” and “Fear has the power to inhibit potential, hinder the present and spoil the future”. Well, it’s precisely through repetition (reading sacred books, listening to sermons, chanting, practicing rituals and saying prayers) that religions manage to program brains to accept their obvious puerilities, absurdities and perversities, and it’s through fear (threat of punishment) that they manage to inhibit the acknowledgement of this.
		</p>
		<p>
			By exposing the contradictions and irrationalities, for example, of the Bible and Christianity, what my book <i>Liberated from Religion</i> does is to deprogram minds dominated by religious brainwashing, taking away their fear of reflecting, opening the way for them to liberate themselves from the darkness of religion and come out into the light of Freethought.

			This book is more personal: I talk about my origins, Evangelical family, time in Christian schools and reveal the name of the church in which I was indoctrinated. I undoubtedly demonstrate that the belief in God is the product of fear, brainwashing and religious hysteria and that, because of this, there are no reasons to waste time (much less money) on invisible beings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many people are prejudiced against atheists, think that disbelieving in God makes people immoral and evil. In <i>Wasting Time on God</i>, I show that this prejudice is 100% unfounded. Over the millennia, people with God in their hearts have committed unspeakable evils. Still today, believing in God is reason for discord, hostility and violence. In some parts of the world, even war.
		</p>
		<p>
			Disbelieving in invisible beings is the most normal thing in the world. Pure and simple, Atheism is a natural result of intellectual honesty.

				“Excellent work! Paulo shares his intimate experience with hyperreligious indoctrination from child on and how to break free. On the way, he uses sometimes humor, sometimes radical messages, to make the reader understand God is an invisible fantasy to make your life, or the life of others, irrational and a misery. So, everyone who is still religious despite modern science, please read this book!”<cite><span class="quote-author">— Review on Amazon</span></cite>

			<blockquote class="quote" style="margin-top: 20px">
				“Best book I’ve ever read! I’m still speechless. <i>Liberated from Religion</i> is splendid and should be read by everyone. The author’s analyses are sensational and written in easy-to-understand language. I don’t usually review books, but felt compelled to express my immense gratitude for this one. Sensational!”<cite><span class="quote-author">— Review on Apple Books</span></cite>

				“Definitely worth reading! This is one of the best books I’ve ever read! Honestly: you will have to believe me, when I say this! There’s a lot of wisdom there, great insights, the author has a wonderful way with words and a delightful sense of humour, even while handling a subject as morose as religion often is.”<cite><span class="quote-author">— Review on Amazon</span></cite>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote class="quote" style="margin-top: 20px">
				“Paulo Bittencourt challenges religious belief, with a focus on Christianity. He champions freethinking, asking that believers step back from what they unquestioningly accept and think for themselves. He defines a freethinker as ‘someone who, in the search for truth, does not trust revelation, tradition and authority, but evidence, logic and reason’. The book is clearly written, in a lively style, and raises many serious questions about religion and the nature of religious faith.”<cite><span class="quote-author">— Review on Amazon</span></cite>

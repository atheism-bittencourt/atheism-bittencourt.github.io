			Paulo Bittencourt’s Artistic Life
		</h1>
		<p class="below-title">
			I was born in 1966 in Castro, Brazil, but I spent my childhood in Rio de Janeiro. My mother took me (and my three brothers) to the Adventist Church. At the age of 22, I stopped being a sheep and became a freethinker.<br>
			<span class="indent">I’ve always enjoyed drawing, photographing and singing. Singing ended up becoming the main way I express myself artistically.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">These are just a few of the many artistic stations of my life.</span>

		<p style="margin-top: 2px">
			I was the bass of a gospel quartet at the Paraná Adventist Institute, a boarding school in the Maringá region. Our quartet even performed at a festival in Curitiba, Paraná’s capital. I sang also in this school’s choir and was often invited to sing solos (1982).

		<p style="margin-top: 2px">
			In 1987, I went to study Theology at the Adventist Institute of Education, a boarding college in São Paulo, to become a church pastor. With my head full of questions, two and a half years later I abandoned my studies and, with the 600 dollars I had earned selling bibles door to door, went on an adventure to Europe, where I ended up staying. At the AIE, I sang in the choir, but I also did a lot of solos. I had been considered to become the baritone of the Brazilian The King’s Heralds Quartet, a kind of The Beatles of the Adventist Church.

			I moved to Europe in 1989. After a short stay in Portugal, France, England and Germany, I ended up in Austria, where I stayed and, at the Konservatorium der Stadt Wien, studied Opera Singing. In the photo, I’m at a rehearsal of the Arnold Schoenberg Choir for a concert at the Musikverein, in Vienna (1994). With this choir, I performed also at the famous Carnegie Hall, in New York.

		<p style="margin-top: 2px">
			Playing and singing bossa nova in Volksgarten park, in the center of Vienna (1999). One day, I passed by there and saw and heard an Austrian playing bossa nova, which I, despite being Brazilian, barely knew. I was so enchanted that I bought a guitar and, learning by doing, began playing (and singing) in this park myself, which is in front of the Parliament. It became a meeting point, sometimes even with beer or wine.

			What is Humanism?
		</h1>
		<p class="below-h1">
			Humanism is a worldview that centers on human beings (their experiences, capacities and responsibilities) as the foundation for understanding life and making ethical choices. It affirms that humans possess inherent worth and that meaning, morality and knowledge arise from human reason, creativity and concern for others.<br>
			<span class="indent">The roots of Humanism can be traced to ancient Greece and Rome, where philosophers such as Socrates and Aristotle emphasized reason and ethics grounded in human nature. These ideas reemerged powerfully during the Renaissance, when thinkers argued that education, critical inquiry and engagement with art and literature could improve both individuals and society. This historical Humanism focused on developing human potential rather than preparing for an afterlife.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Contemporary Humanism is typically secular and naturalistic. It relies on Science as the best method for understanding the Universe and rejects supernatural explanations as necessary for morality or purpose. Humanists believe ethical values should be based on human well-being, using empathy, Logic and evidence to determine what helps individuals and communities thrive.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Another defining feature of Humanism is personal and social responsibility. Because meaning is not handed down by external authorities, humans must take responsibility for their choices and their impact on others. This often leads Humanists to support ideals such as freedom of thought, equality, human rights and democratic decision-making.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Overall, Humanism is not a rigid doctrine, but a flexible approach to life. It encourages people to think critically, act compassionately and work toward a world in which human dignity and flourishing are central goals.</span>

			“The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here’s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride: Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year and, instead, spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.”<cite><span class="quote-author">— Bill Hicks</span><span class="quote-source">(<i>It’s Just a Ride</i>)</span></cite>

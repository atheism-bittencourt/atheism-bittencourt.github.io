			What is Humanism?
		</h1>
		<p class="below-title">
			Humanism is the outcome of a long tradition of free thought that has inspired many of the great thinkers and artists and gave rise to Science.<br>
			<span class="indent">Humanism is ethical: it affirms the worth, dignity and autonomy of the individual and the right of every human being to the greatest possible freedom compatible with the rights of others. Humanists have a duty of care to all of Humanity, including future generations. Humanists believe that morality is an intrinsic part of human nature, based on understanding and a concern for others, needing no external sanction.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Humanism is rational: it seeks to use Science creatively, not destructively. Humanists believe that the solutions to the world’s problems lie in human thought and action, rather than in divine intervention. Humanism advocates the application of the methods of Science and free inquiry to the problems of human welfare. Humanists also believe that the application of Science and technology must be tempered by human values. Science gives us the means, but human values must propose the ends.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Humanism supports democracy and human rights: it aims at the fullest possible development of every human being. It holds that democracy and human development are matters of right. The principles of democracy and human rights can be applied to many human relationships and are not restricted to methods of government.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Humanism insists that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility: it ventures to build a world on the idea of the free person, responsible to society, and recognizes our dependence on and responsibility for the natural world. Humanism is undogmatic, imposing no creed upon its adherents. It’s, thus, committed to education free from indoctrination.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for an alternative to dogmatic religion: the major religions claim to be based on revelations fixed for all time, and many seek to impose their world views on all of Humanity. Humanism recognizes that reliable knowledge of the world and ourselves arises through a continuing process of observation, evaluation and revision.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Humanism values artistic creativity and imagination and recognizes the transforming power of art: it affirms the importance of literature, music and the visual and performing arts for personal development and fulfillment.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Humanism is a life stance aiming at the maximum possible fulfillment through the cultivation of ethical and creative living and offers ethical and rational means of addressing the challenges of our times. Humanism can be a way of life for everyone everywhere.</span>

			What is Humanism?
		</h1>
		<p class="below-h1">
			Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively. It prioritizes human reason, ethics and justice over religious or supernatural explanations, viewing humans as capable of leading meaningful and moral lives without reliance on divine authority. At its core, Humanism affirms the dignity and worth of every person, promoting critical thinking, compassion and responsibility for improving the human condition.<br>
			<span class="indent">The roots of Humanism trace back to the Renaissance period in Europe during the 14th to 16th centuries. Emerging in Italy, it revived interest in classical Greek and Roman texts, shifting focus from medieval theocentric views to human potential and achievements. Scholars known as humanists studied the humanities (literature, philosophy, history and rhetoric) to cultivate well-rounded individuals. Key figures like Petrarch and Erasmus championed the idea that education and reason could elevate Humanity.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Renaissance Humanism celebrated anthropocentrism, placing humans at the center rather than God. It encouraged the pursuit of knowledge through observation and inquiry, laying groundwork for the scientific revolution. This worldview inspired advancements in art, science and politics, with thinkers like Leonardo da Vinci embodying the ideal of the multifaceted, curious human capable of mastering diverse fields through intellect and creativity.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">In the modern era, Humanism evolved into secular humanism, particularly in the 20th century. Manifestos such as the Humanist Manifesto I (1933) and II (1973) outlined a non-theistic approach, basing morality on human experience, Science and empathy rather than religious doctrine. Secular humanists advocate for human rights, freedom of thought, democracy and environmental stewardship, rejecting dogma in favor of evidence-based reasoning.</span><br>
			<span class="indent"> Today, Humanism influences global ethics, education and social movements. It’s not a rigid doctrine, but a flexible approach to life. Humanism encourages people to think critically, act compassionately and work toward a world in which human dignity and flourishing are central goals.</span>

			“The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here’s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride: Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year and, instead, spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.”<cite><span class="quote-author">— Bill Hicks</span><span class="quote-source">(<i>It’s Just a Ride</i>)</span></cite>

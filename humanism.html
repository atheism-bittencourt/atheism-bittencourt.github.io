			What is Humanism?
		</h1>
		<p class="below-h1">
			Humanism is a progressive philosophical and ethical lifestance that affirms the inherent dignity and worth of every human being. It’s widely recognized as a non-theistic worldview that relies on reason, Science and empathy rather than supernatural or divine revelation to understand the Universe and guide human conduct. Humanists emphasize that morality is a natural product of human culture and social evolution, aiming for the greater good and personal fulfillment in the only life we are certain to have.<br>
			<span class="indent">The historical roots of Humanism trace back to ancient Greece and Rome, where philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle first explored ethics through human inquiry. However, it flourished most significantly during the Renaissance as a movement to recover and interpret classical learning, shifting the intellectual focus from medieval scholasticism toward the study of the humanities (grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy). This transition placed “Man as the measure of all things”, prioritizing human agency and achievements over rigid religious dogma.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">In contemporary practice, modern secular Humanism is defined by its commitment to scientific naturalism and the rejection of the supernatural. Major international bodies, such as Humanists International and the American Humanist Association, define it as a democratic life stance that asserts human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning to their own lives. This involves using critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning to address global challenges, from climate change to social justice.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Ethics within Humanism are situational and autonomous, meaning they are derived from human needs and social consequences rather than theological commands. Humanists believe that being good without God is not only possible but necessary, as it encourages individuals to act out of compassion and concern for others rather than fear of divine punishment or hope for a reward in an afterlife. This perspective fosters a strong focus on universal human rights, social responsibility and the cultivation of a more humane society.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">Ultimately, Humanism offers a holistic view of life that celebrates human creativity, imagination and the pursuit of knowledge. By acknowledging the interconnectedness of all life and the fragility of our planet, humanists work toward a future where well-being and justice are realized through human effort alone. It remains a dynamic philosophy, evolving to address new ethical frontiers in technology and globalization while staying rooted in the core values of reason and human dignity.</span>

				“The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here’s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride: Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year and, instead, spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.”<cite><span class="quote-author">— Bill Hicks</span><span class="quote-source">(<i>It’s Just a Ride</i>)</span></cite>

		It’s very common for religious people to say that believing in God is rational, so rational that not believing in God, that is, being an atheist can only be revolt, rebellion. Evidently, the majority of believers don’t know what Atheism is, otherwise they wouldn’t think about it so wrongly. This misconception stems from followers of religions confusing god (lowercase g) with God (uppercase G). The same word, but its initial makes a big difference. Religious people don’t believe in God, but in gods. Jews, Christians and Muslims, for example, call Yahweh, Jesus and Allah God. Yet, calling these supernatural beings God does not make them be God. Yahweh, Jesus and Allah are not God, but gods, the deities of their religions, in the same way that Brahma, Shango and Nhanderuvuçu are not God, but deities of the Hindu, Yoruba and Tupi-Guarani religions.<br>
		<span class="indent">Those who believe in gods are theists and believe not by reasoning, but by faith. Those who believe by reasoning are not theists, but deists. Deists deduce that the Universe must have been caused by a transcendent intelligence, which they call God, about which nothing can be known, reason why it can’t be defined. Deism, therefore, is not a religion. The moment God is defined, that is, given a name and it’s said that God is so and so and wants this and that, a god is invented, a deity to whom his inventors attribute, among other things, their own character traits. Reading, for example, the Bible, it doesn’t take a genius to realize and feel that its god is a clear reflection of the mentality of the men who invented him. By the way, initially the Hebrews were polytheistic like any other people, and Yahweh was just one of the many gods they worshiped. Yahweh even had a wife: the goddess Asherah. Over the centuries, he rose in preference and was elevated to main deity. It was only after the Babylonian Exile and for political reasons that Yahweh was imposed as the only god. Likewise, the Arabs worshiped a bunch of gods, one of them Allah, who even had daughters: the goddesses Al-Lat, Al-Uzza and Manat. Motivated by the desire to lead and transform the many tribes into a single people, Muhammad created Islam and, also through wars, forced the monotheistic worship of Allah.</span><br>
		<span class="indent">When a god is invented, a religion is invented for him, or he is inserted into an existing religion. The problem is that religion is no good. In addition to causing division, religions teach things that must be accepted without questioning, and that under threat of punishment. Yet, how could it be natural not to question? How could it be normal to be threatened?</span><br>
		<span class="indent">Religion is not harmless either. In the supernatural, that is, imaginary world, everything is possible. A person can, for example, be convinced that his god gave him orders. This cannot be verified. Even if what this person thinks his god ordered him to do is criminal, he won’t dare refuse to obey. After all, “God” is above everything, and the thing he most hates is disobedience.</span><br>
		<span class="indent">Madness? Well, that’s exactly what, for example, the Bible teaches: “We must obey God rather than human beings!” (Acts 5:29). Every day, somewhere in the world believers are arrested for committing crimes at the behest of their gods. This includes worshipers of the god Jesus, the son of the god Yahweh. There are Christian mothers who kill their own children because they heard the voice of “God” commanding them to do so. What Christian could prove that they didn’t hear the voice of the god of the Bible, if he commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac and Abraham obeyed? In the <i>New Testament</i>, the patriarch is praised as a hero of faith, for having carried out the sacrifice of his son without blinking (not consummated only because another voice told him it was all just a test). Even for the Bronze Age, shouldn’t the reaction of a father who hears a voice commanding him to stab his own son be to think he is going crazy?</span><br>
		<span class="indent">When a Christian murders a homosexual, another Christian has no way to consider it absurd and reproach him, saying he is not doing the will of “God”, because every Christian knows he is: “The Lord said: [...] ‘If a man has sexual relations with a man […], both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads’” (Leviticus 20:1,13). The Christian who doesn’t kill homosexuals because he considers it absurd is admitting that his god gave absurd orders.</span><br>
		<span class="indent">Although Deism isn’t a religion and, therefore, is harmless, it’s not free from incoherence. There simply is no irrefutable evidence that God exists. Thousands of gods and thousands of religions that disagree with and even combat each other are evidence that believers themselves don’t know if God exists. Desiring that God exist doesn’t make God exist. Deism is wishful thinking and, therefore, intellectual dishonesty. Add to this that God leaving his creation to its own devices and God not existing are, in practice, the same thing.</span><br>
		<span class="indent">Atheism is a natural result of intellectual honesty. In view of a long list of things that point to the Universe, Earth and life not being designed, to claim that God exists is to be intellectually dishonest. Trying to explain a mystery (the existence of the Universe) with another mystery (God) adds to the mystery, complicates things, generates incoherences and contradictions and increases the number of questions, whose “answers” are even more unsatisfactory. The belief in God is so baseless that if I, obviously lying, say the Universe was created by me, no one will be capable of proving that it wasn’t. By the way, I really can be the creator of the Universe and not be aware of that because I’m a human copy of myself that I placed here without the memory that I’m God. As ridiculous as it sounds, this is not impossible!</span><br>
		<span class="indent">The many imperfections of the Universe, Earth and life, such as star explosions, earthquakes and children with cancer, make sense only without a Great Architect, Divine Clockmaker or Intelligent Designer. Whether we like it or not, everything is the way it is because that’s how everything developed. There are no reasons to believe in God and there are many reasons not to believe in God. Not believing in God is not, then, revolt, rebellion, but the most rational thing in the world.</span><br>
		<span class="indent">Atheism has a negative connotation only because the majority of people still believe in “God”. In order not to feel idiotic believing in invisible beings (and places), theists need to demonize atheists. Believers claim that disbelieving induces to practice evils. How, if this is impossible? The atheist who commits an evil is not following any atheistic doctrine, because Atheism has no doctrines. After all, there is no atheist bible. Atheism is disbelief in the existence of gods. Disbelief — and nothing else. Just like disbelieving in Santa Claus, disbelieving in God doesn’t command to do anything. Atheism, therefore, is not a religion, not even a philosophy. And the atheist who gives the hungry to eat, gives the thirsty to drink, invites the strangers in, clothes the naked and visits the sick and the imprisoned is not aiming at any reward, for example eternal life in a mansion of gold. The atheist who does good does good not because someone commanded him to do good, but because it does one good to do good.</span><br>
		<span class="indent">When Catholics killed Protestants and Protestants killed Catholics, they were absolutely sure they were doing good, since it’s an ordinance of the god of the Bible to kill heretics. Is there anything more bizarre than a follower of pacifist Jesus killing a follower of pacifist Jesus for being a pacifist? Well, that’s exactly what Lutherans and Calvinists did: they killed the Anabaptists, just because these Protestants, in addition to rebaptizing themselves and preaching the separation between Church and State, refused to take up arms. When Catholics and Protestants burned “witches”, it never crossed their minds that they were committing crimes. Quite the contrary: they were proud to be doing the will of “God”. And who spent centuries persecuting and massacring Jews? Atheists? No. Followers of a book inspired by “God” and written by Jews. The Christians who condemn the killings carried out by Muslims suffer from serious cognitive dissonance, as these believers are doing nothing other than obeying the orders of “God”, that is, Allah. Those who believe in “God” don’t have the morals to condemn those who believe in “God”. The only ones who have the morals to condemn absurdities and evils perpetrated by worshipers of gods are those who don’t worship any god: atheists.</span><br>
